I heard firearms training was not necessary, true?

The firearmproficiency portion of training no longer applies to the following individuals:  Out-of-state retired law enforcement officers or SC retired law enforcement officers whose certification hs expired (must submit proof of graduation from a federal or state academy that included firearms training as a graduation requirement) or retired/former military personnel who completed basic military training (must provide DD214).
