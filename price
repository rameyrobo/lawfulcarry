How much is the course and what does that include?
I believe our course is the most affordable in the state at $85. We include everything you will need to apply for your SC CWP permit. This includes the application, two sets of fingerprints,  SLED mandated course, the use of a Sig 22 with suppressor, 50 rounds of ammo and the use of a private shooting area.

How much does the required SLED background check cost?
SLED requires a $50 bank check or money order for their background check and processing. This fee is submitted with your application.  For your convenience, we pre-purchase bank checks and will have them available to submit with your application to SLED.

How much money should I bring to class?
$135 cash or personal check to cover the course fee and the SLED required bank check. We work through lunch so bring your lunch or bring a few bucks and we will get a
pizza deliver.
