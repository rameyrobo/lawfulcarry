How long is the course?
It is a SLED approved course. The course is designed to be completed in one day or two evenings.

What is involved in getting a SC CWP permit?
There is a SLED approved course that covers gun safety and handling and concealed carry laws. There is a 50 question written test. You must score a minimum of
70%. You will shoot 50 rounds, 35 of which must be in the black of the silhouette target from 3 to 15 yards.

I haven’t been a student in years and am concerned about taking the written test.
You will be more than prepared to take the test by the end of the course.  Remember, if I could teach you to fly an airplane, I can teach you the necessary course material to successfully pass the written test. I have over 46 years of teaching experience. All of our students have been successful in the past (even an 86 year old grandmother).

Is there some study material I can review ahead of time?
The SLED website contains SC CWP law which you can review prior to the class.  www.SLED.SC.GOV
